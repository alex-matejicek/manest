Manest is a parody of [Marast](https://marast.fit.cvut.cz/cs/about), a much more full-featured content management system for math courses by the Department of Applied Mathematics at FIT CTU.

This was mostly created as a joke, but also to unironically help me study basic JavaScript.

Uploaded for the good people of EY. :)
